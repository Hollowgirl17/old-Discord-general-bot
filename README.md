# Discord-Moderation-bot
This is a basic discord moderation bot you can self host, edit and run as you wish. I've pulled code from different locations with edits and most code primarily done by myself especially in the mute/unmute commands.

Upon downloading this bot the following things need doing:
You need to add your bot token into the correct places, currently they're blank.
You need to change the role ID's / names in Mute and Unmute to suit your server.

If you have any issues don't hesitate to contact me and I'll be happy to help/advise further. There may or may not be future changes but I'll upload them if there is. I'd also love to hear feedback as this is my first public discord bot.
