# Discord-bot
This is a basic discord bot you can self host, edit and run as you wish. I've pulled code from different locations with edits and most code primarily done by myself especially in the mute/unmute commands.

Upon downloading this bot the following things need doing:
You need to add your bot token into the correct places, currently they're blank.
You need to add your YoutubeAPI into play
You need to change the role names and channel names (when neccesary) to your server role names/channel names


If you have any issues don't hesitate to contact me and I'll be happy to help/advise further. There may or may not be future changes but I'll upload them if there is. I'd also love to hear feedback as this is my first public discord bot.

Features included:
High quality music,
Moderation commands,
Ping command,
Warning system that tracks via JSON,
and so much more

2022 Edit:
This bot no longer works on the newest version of discord.js and will need updating to function
